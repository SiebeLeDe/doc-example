# Project Overview

This project is a try-out for testing the Mandelbrot set in Python, and is part of the CodeRefinery course. The project contains documentation for both reStructuredText and Markdown, and uses the autodoc API generator to automatically generate documentation from the source code.

## What is the Mandelbrot Set?

The Mandelbrot set is a beautiful fractal and is defined as the set of complex numbers `c` for which the sequence `z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from `z=0`, i.e., for which the sequence `|z_n|` remains bounded in value.

## Documentation

The project includes documentation in both reStructuredText and Markdown formats. The documentation provides an overview of the project, as well as detailed explanations of the code and how to use it.

## API Documentation

The project uses the autodoc API generator to automatically generate documentation from the source code. This makes it easy to keep the documentation up-to-date as the code changes, and ensures that the documentation is always accurate and complete.
