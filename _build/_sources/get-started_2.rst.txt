Get Started
===========

Here we will see how we can make a Mandelbrot set plot with Python code.

.. important::
    
   This exercise focuses on intermediate level Python users who feel comfortable with using NumPy and complex numbers.

MandelBrot set
--------------

The Mandelbrot set is a beautiful fractal and is defined as the set of complex numbers `c` for which the sequence `z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from `z=0`, i.e., for which the sequence `|z_n|` remains bounded in value.
