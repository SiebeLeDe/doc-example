Here we will see how we can make a Mandelbrot set plot with python code.

``` {Important}
This exercise focuses on intermediate level python users who feel comfortable using numpy and complex numbers

## MandelBrot set

The Mandelbrot set is a beautiful fractal and is defined as the set of complex numbers {math}`c` for which the sequence {math}`z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from {math}`z=0`, i.e., for which the sequence {math}`|z_n|` remains bounded in value.
