# Get Started

Here we will see how we can make a Mandelbrot set plot with python code.

> [!IMPORTANT] This exercise focuses on intermediate level python users who feel comfortable wiht using numpy and complex numbers

## MandelBrot set

The Mandelbrot set is a beautiful fractal and is defined as the set of complex numbers {math}`c` for which the sequence {math}`z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c` does not diverge when iterated from {math}`z=0`, i.e., for which the sequence {math}`|z_n|` remains bounded in value.

## Code Example

```{literalinclude} ../src/mandelbrot.py
    :language: python
```

## Code Explanation

Please see :func:`mandelbrot.mandelbrot`

``` {autofunction} mandelbrot.mandelbrot
    :noindex:
```
